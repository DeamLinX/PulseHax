# PulseHax
Hacking pulsus has never been easier
So you want to run PulseHax. Its actually pretty easy! At this time PulxeHax is only compatible with chromium based browsers. At the moment, there is limited functionality for firefox however that was purely unintentional and may be subject to change. 

To use PulseHax, first either download and extract the PulseHax.zip archive or clone the repository.  


Next in order to add PulseHax to Chrome, navigate to chrome settings, then select extensions from the left hand side bar, and enable developer mode in the upper right hand corner.

Finally select load unpacked from the upper left selections, and navigate to the PulseHax directory when prompted. And you're done!

Eventually I would like to list this privately on the chrome web store to further ease installation, but there is a $5 fee to create a developer account that just isn't worth paying for the 5 total users I expect.
